Model Similarity Analysis Report
Comparing: NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.2-3B vs meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B

Key Findings:
1. Overall Similarity:
   - Mean Cosine Similarity: 0.9995
   - Mean CKA: 1.0000
   - Mean L2 Distance: 1.82

2. Layer-wise Analysis:
   - Early Layers (0-10): Highly similar representations
   - Middle Layers (11-30): Consistent internal patterns
   - Final Layers (31-end): Increasing divergence

Interpretation:
- Models share fundamental representation learning
- Subtle differences emerge in deeper layers
- Suggests similar base architecture with task-specific variations

Visualization Insights:
- Cosine Similarity: Gradual decline across layers
- CKA: Maintains high correlation
- L2 Distance: Increases with layer depth

Conclusion:
Models exhibit strong structural similarity with nuanced differences in final representations.
